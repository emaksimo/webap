(1) instrum_function.m
calculate statistics of CNR for each PPI, each scanning distance
skewness, kurtosis, average, inter-quartile range, maximum likly-hood estimator (peak of PDF), std, 3 normal distribution tests

(2) result.m

check all PPI files to detect those that correspond the criteria of homogeneity
impose filtering conditions (using statistics for all PPI)
determine (automatically or visually) the distances where exp(delta CNR) is const
calculate alpha within these distances
(eigther with the multi-angle, eigther with the slope method)

as a result we get the list of PPI files (ij, L), written in listing_2lnR.m
impose the reference PPI
evaluate beta ratio
plot the ratios : alpha(n)/alpha(ref) and beta(n)/beta(ref) for the best PPI selection

instrum_function_result.m is used   ;   

(3) result_instr_func.m
result_instr_func_allbestPPI.m

evaluate beta ratio (again)
use the beta ratio to calculate F(Ri)*K*Beta(ref)
extract F(R) using beta ratio and F(Ri)*K*Beta(ref)

as a result we get the offset K*beta(ref) and the value of Instr Func (within 0 - 1), written in instrumental_correction.m

(4) lidar_correction.m
remove F(R) and  the offset K*beta(ref) from all PPI
